# MATLAB Simulation for Paper "ORBGRAND Is Exactly Capacity-achieving via Rank Companding"
## Folder Structure

- **BPSK/**  
  Contains simulations for Fig. 1.  
  Running the `mtkl.m` file will generate the corresponding data results.

- **BICM/**  
  Contains simulations for Fig. 4.  

    - **ORBGRAND/**  
      Contains the results obtained from **exact calculations**.  

    - **ORBGRAND ideal interleaving/**  
      Contains approximate results assuming **ideal interleaving**.


## Usage

1. Open MATLAB.  
2. Navigate to the folder.  
3. Run the main simulation file (`mtkl.m`).  
4. The generated results will be saved in the folder.

## Notes

- Make sure all dependent scripts and functions are in the same folder or added to MATLAB path.
